h2. Description

This project provides code to generate a solution (results.txt) to the "github contest":http://contest.github.com August 2009.

<b>Note</b>: This is a project designed for me to learn more about Ruby rather than seriously compete in the competition.

h2. Details

The objective is to recommend repositories to users. Specifically to predict which repositories to recommend to a user given existing known user-repository relationships.

h3. Data

The following is a summary of the data provided in the competition, see /data/readme.txt for more detail.

* <b>data.txt</b> 440,237 known user-to-repository relationships
* <b>repos.txt</b> 120,867 known repositories (id, name, date created, parent repository)
* <b>lang.txt</b> language information for 73,496 repositories (id,lang;total_lines,...)
* <b>test.txt</b> 4,788 users from data.txt, each of which requires a prediction of (up to) 10 repositories

Observations
* All repos with parents have those parents in the dataset
* There are 5 repo language definitions for repos that are not in main repo set
* All but 2 of the test users are in the main user set (2 are unknown or new users)

Some indicators that may be exploited include
* language correlation
* repository size correlation
* repository hierarchy size or type correlation

h3. Strategies

* Random: This is my base line strategy. It provides proof of concept for data parsing, internal testing and submission. For each user id a random set between 0 and 10 of existing repositories are recommended.
* kNN: Nearest Neighbour

h3. Validation Testing

...still a work in progress

h3. Open Questions

# How exactly does the online scoring work? 
## Are incorrect recommendations punished?
## Is recommendation order important (list or user set of recommendations)?
